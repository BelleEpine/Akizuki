# Akizuki - A Discord Bot written in Python utilizing the Discord.py library.

Written as a personal project, this is my first foray into something as advanced as a Bot that interacts w/ an API and all.

# Dependencies

* Discord.py
* Python 3.0+

# Setup

* Install dependencies 
* Enter the bin folder and run setup.bat
* When prompted, enter the bot token and prefix you would like to use.
* Run the runbot.bat file in the main directory. **If you have not run setup.bat, the bot WILL NOT RUN.**

**Or, manual set up:**

*Install dependencies
*In \Akizuki\Akizuki\config.py , enter the bot token and prefix you would like to use, **OR** into config.txt with the token first and prefix separated by a line.
* Either run runbot.bat or manually run \Akizuki\Akizuki\Akizuki.py on the command line.
