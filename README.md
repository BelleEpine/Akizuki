# Akizuki - A Discord Bot written in Python utilizing the Discord.py library.

Written as a personal project, this is my first foray into something as advanced as a Bot that interacts w/ an API and all.

# Dependencies

* Discord.py
* Python 3.0+
* **Check main/requirements.txt for specifics.**

# Setup

* Install dependencies 
* Run *setup.bat*
* When prompted, enter the bot token and prefix you would like to use.
* Run the *runbot.bat* file in the main directory. **If you have not run setup.bat, the bot WILL NOT RUN.**

**Or, manual set up:**

* Install dependencies
* In akizuki.py, enter your credentials.
* Either run runbot.bat or manually run akizuki.py on the command line.

# Etc.

* *Akizuki is named after the WWII Era Destroyer.*
* I'm still learning, don't mind any horrible mistakes! :)
